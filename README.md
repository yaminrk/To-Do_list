## Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

- `frontend`: This folder contains all the React components and logic for the client-side of the application.
- `backend`: This folder contains the server-side logic and the MongoDB database operations.

## Features

- Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Tasks are displayed in a tabular format with details like email, title, description, and status.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for running both the frontend and backend concurrently.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can start both servers by running `npm start`. This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
5. If you want to run the frontend and backend separately for development purposes, you can use `npm run dev`.

Now you can access the To-Do List web app on your local host!
