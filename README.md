# To-Do List

To-Do List is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow a client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.

### Libraries and Frameworks

- **React.js**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. Its component-based architecture greatly enhances reusability and readability of code.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework used for creating modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements as well as prebuilt components.

### Database

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

- `frontend`: This folder contains all the React components and logic for the client-side of the application.
- `backend`: This folder contains the server-side logic and the MongoDB database operations.

## Features

- Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Tasks are displayed in a tabular format with details like email, title, description, and status.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for running both the frontend and backend concurrently.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can start both servers by running `npm start`. This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
5. If you want to run the frontend and backend separately for development purposes, you can use `npm run dev`.

Now you can access the To-Do List web app on your local host!
